{"name":"Gaitoraid","tagline":"Usage of gait information to establish identity of a person in traffic cameras","body":"### Welcome to Gaitoraid\r\nGaitoraid is an open source image processing algorithm developed mainly for use in traffic cameras and identifying people through their gait information.\r\n\r\nFork our repo and contribute to it.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/sgang007/gaitoraid\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Approaches to be tried\r\nWe have two approaches in mind.\r\n1. Variational Approximation on Bayesian Inference to match the model with the existing database.\r\n2. Usage of ANNs to do Deep Learning on training images and learning gait information.\r\n\r\n### Initial Abstract\r\nFollow our abstract given in this doc: [Research Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqx0MPoKnpuhDdmuxCY-YuHza-Hx7sZAX9lJiBGvwzs/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe main work is done by Antariksh Kar (@AntarikshaKar) and Shubhojyoti Ganguly(@sgang007)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
